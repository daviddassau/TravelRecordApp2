# Travel Record App

This is an application/walk-through that I am doing that corresponds with a course I purchased from Udemy.com

This is the first Xamarin-based mobile application that I have developed. For those of you that are unfamiliar with Xamarin, it is a Microsoft product inside Visual Studio, that allows developers to create cross-platform mobile applications using only C#. Yes, you read that correctly! Gone are the days of having to learn more than one language in order to have your mobile app available for both Android AND iOS. All you need now is your C# skills, and you can develop native applications for Apple and Android devices!
